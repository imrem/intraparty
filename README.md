Repository for Tweet IDs for the project "Intra-Party Politics and European Multiparty Governments"

This repository contains the IDs of tweets collected during the project. We unfortunately cannot upload metadata or contents of the tweets (i.e. "hydrated tweets") due to the [Developer terms](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/more-on-restricted-use-cases). Our main data collection period was from 2017-2022, legislative periods starting earlier or ending later than that might therefore not be complete.
